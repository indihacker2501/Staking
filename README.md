# Staking and Reward System

## Overview
This project implements a **staking system** where users can stake **XFI tokens** in exchange for **stXFI tokens** (representing their stake) and earn **rwXFI rewards** over time. Users can later unstake their tokens and claim their accumulated rewards.

The project consists of three Solidity smart contracts:
1. **RewardXFI.sol** â€“ The reward token contract (rwXFI).
2. **StakeXFI.sol** â€“ The staking token contract (stXFI).
3. **Staking.sol** â€“ The core staking contract, handling deposits, rewards, and withdrawals.

A **frontend** is also available to interact with the staking system.

## Smart Contracts
### **1. RewardXFI (rwXFI - Reward Token)**
This is an **ERC-20 token** used as the staking reward.

- **Constructor:** Mints an initial supply to the contract deployer.
- **Transfer Functionality:** Standard ERC-20 token transfers.

### **2. StakeXFI (stXFI - Staking Token)**
This token represents the user's stake in the system.

- **Minting:** When a user stakes XFI, they receive 100 stXFI per 1 XFI staked.
- **Burning:** When unstaking, the equivalent stXFI is burned before returning XFI to the user.
- **Transfers:** Supports ERC-20 transfers.

### **3. Staking (Core Staking Contract)**
This contract allows users to stake **XFI tokens**, earn **rewards**, and withdraw their staked assets.

- **Staking:** Users send XFI to receive **stXFI tokens**.
- **Rewards Calculation:** Users earn **rwXFI** over time, based on the stake amount.
- **Claim Rewards:** Users can claim their accumulated **rwXFI**.
- **Unstake:** Users can withdraw their **XFI**, burning **stXFI** in the process.
- **Reward Percentage:** Configurable by the contract owner.

### **Key Events:**
- `Staked(address user, uint256 amount, bool isXFI)` â€“ Triggered when a user stakes.
- `RewardsCalculated(address user, uint256 reward)` â€“ Logs calculated rewards.
- `RewardsClaimed(address user, uint256 reward)` â€“ Logs reward claims.
- `Unstaked(address user, uint256 amount, bool isXFI)` â€“ Logs unstaking actions.
- `RewardPercentageUpdated(uint256 newPercentage)` â€“ Logs reward rate changes.

## Frontend
The frontend allows users to interact with the staking system via **Metamask** and **Web3.js/Ethers.js**.

### **Features:**
âœ… **Stake XFI** â€“ Convert XFI into stXFI.
âœ… **Claim Rewards** â€“ Withdraw accumulated rwXFI.
âœ… **Unstake Tokens** â€“ Convert stXFI back into XFI.
âœ… **View Balances** â€“ Display user balances for stXFI, rwXFI, and XFI.
âœ… **Responsive UI** â€“ User-friendly interface with real-time updates.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React.js (Next.js/Vue.js can also be used)
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ethers.js / Web3.js
- **Wallet Connection:** MetaMask / WalletConnect
- **UI Components:** TailwindCSS / Bootstrap

## **Installation & Deployment**
### **1. Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/staking-system.git
cd staking-system
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Deploy Contracts**
Modify `hardhat.config.js` or `truffle-config.js` with your network settings.

#### **Compile Contracts:**
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

#### **Deploy Contracts:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

Save the deployed contract addresses for frontend integration.

### **4. Start Frontend**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## **Usage Guide**
1. **Connect Wallet** using Metamask.
2. **Stake XFI** to receive stXFI tokens.
3. **Wait for rewards** to accumulate.
4. **Claim rwXFI rewards** anytime.
5. **Unstake when needed** to retrieve XFI.

---

## **Security Considerations**
- Contract is **Ownable**, allowing only the owner to modify reward rates.
- Uses **OpenZeppelin ERC-20 standards** for security.
- **Requires sufficient XFI balance** in contract to facilitate unstaking.

## **Future Improvements**
ðŸš€ **Auto-compounding rewards**
ðŸš€ **Flexible staking periods**
ðŸš€ **Governance mechanism for community decisions**
